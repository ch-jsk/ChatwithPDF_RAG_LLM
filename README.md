# ChatwithPDF_RAG_LLM
We tried to build a RAG based chatbot to chat with any PDF of your choice.
Empowering PDF interaction, our project merges LLM and RAG models with Streamlit frontend, Python backend, and Llama2 for open-source accessibility. It aims to enhance user experiences by bridging static PDFs with dynamic, conversational interfaces for seamless information retrieval and communication.
